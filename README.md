# Learnd

Learnd is a personal learning journal for capturing and reviewing resources.

## Quickstart

- Copy `local.mk.example` to `local.mk` and fill in required env vars.
- Run `make run` and open `http://localhost:4500`.

## Auth State Capture (Playwright)

This repo includes a small helper that opens a real (headed) browser so you can log in manually, then saves Playwright `storageState` (cookies + localStorage) for reuse in tests/agents.

1. Configure:
   - Edit `auth.config.json` (`appName`, `baseURL`, optional `loginURL`).
2. Install Playwright (repo-local; this repo gitignores `package.json` and `node_modules/`):
   - `npm i -D playwright`
   - `npx playwright install chromium chromium-headless-shell`
3. Capture auth state:
   - `node scripts/auth-capture.js`

The state is saved to `./.auth/<appName>.json` (and `./.auth/` is gitignored). To refresh it, re-run the capture and confirm the overwrite prompt (or pass `--overwrite`).
If the state file already exists and is still valid, you typically do not need to run capture again.

## Configuration

- `DATABASE_URL` and `API_KEY_HASH` are required.
- `PORT` is optional; it defaults to `4500`.

## Health

- `GET /health` returns `200 OK` with `ok` in the body.
